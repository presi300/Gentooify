>What is Gentooify?

 Gentooify is a simple script that creates a fully 
 functional Gentoo GNU/Linux installation within your 
 current Linux installation, using the 
 stage 3 rootfs tarball and chroot.

>Why would that be useful?

There are many possible uses for this script:
-Using Gentoo's genkernel to generate custom kernels with one command
-Using gentoo's eselect to control things like the java version (within the chroot)
-Flexing with the Gentoo neofetch
 And more...

>How do i start Gentooify after the installation script is finished?

-Type Gentooify in the terminal and enter your root password

>Will this erase any files on my system?

-No, this script shouldn't erase any files

>Where do i find the Gentooify chroot files?

-They should be in /home/Gentooify

>Where can i find the config file?

>It should be in .config/Gentooify

>How do i report bugs?
